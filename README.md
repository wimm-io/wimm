### Storage Backends

#### Memory Storage

- Fast in-memory storage
- Perfect for testing and temporary use
- No persistence between sessions

#### Sled Storage

- Persistent embedded database
- Fast key-value storage
- Automatic data recovery

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up automatic code quality checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Manual run
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Hooks include:

- Rust formatting check
- Clippy lints
- Test execution
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Security audit

## 🔧 Configuration

### Coverage Configuration

The project enforces a **60% minimum coverage threshold**. Configuration in `tarpaulin.toml`:

```toml
[coverage]
fail-under = 60
exclude-files = ["src/main.rs", "tests/*"]

[output]
out = ["Html", "Xml", "Json"]
```

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow includes:

- ✅ Automated testing on all PRs
- ✅ Coverage enforcement (fails below 60%)
- ✅ Code quality checks (rustfmt, clippy)
- ✅ Security audit
- ✅ MSRV compatibility check
- ✅ Automatic coverage comments on PRs

## 🚦 Quality Gates

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage ≥ 60%
- [ ] Code formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings
