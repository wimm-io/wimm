### 🔍 Analysis

**Files with Reduced Coverage:**
<!-- List files that lost coverage -->
- [ ] `file1.rs`: X% → Y% (-Z%)
- [ ] `file2.rs`: X% → Y% (-Z%)

**Possible Causes:**
- [ ] New code added without tests
- [ ] Existing tests removed or commented out
- [ ] Refactoring that removed covered code paths
- [ ] Test configuration changes
- [ ] External dependencies affecting test execution

### 🎯 Action Items

**To Fix This Issue:**
- [ ] Identify uncovered lines in affected files
- [ ] Add unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Review and restore any accidentally removed tests
- [ ] Update existing tests if code was refactored

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Run `make coverage-open` to view detailed HTML report
- [ ] Check uncovered lines highlighted in red
- [ ] Write tests for each uncovered code path
- [ ] Verify edge cases are covered
- [ ] Ensure error handling paths are tested

### 📝 Coverage Improvement Plan

**Target Coverage:** <!-- What coverage % are you aiming for? -->
**Estimated Effort:** <!-- How long will this take? -->

**Specific Areas to Test:**
1. <!-- List specific functions/modules that need tests -->
2.
3.

### ✅ Definition of Done

This issue will be considered resolved when:
- [ ] Coverage is back above {{ MIN_COVERAGE }}%
- [ ] All new code has appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Coverage CI check passes
- [ ] HTML coverage report shows no critical gaps

### 💡 Prevention

**To prevent future coverage drops:**
- [ ] Enable branch protection rules requiring coverage checks
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks to run coverage locally
- [ ] Review coverage impact in pull requests
- [ ] Add coverage requirements to code review checklist
