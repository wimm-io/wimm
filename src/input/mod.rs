//! Input handling module for WIMM terminal interface
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive input processing for the WIMM application,
//! handling keyboard events, command parsing, and input validation. It serves as
//! the bridge between raw terminal input and application commands.
//!
//! **Note**: This module is currently a placeholder with stub implementations.
//! The actual input handling functionality will be implemented in future development cycles.
//!
//! ## Future Features
//! - Keyboard event processing and routing
//! - Command parsing and validation
//! - Input mode handling (Normal vs Insert mode)
//! - Keyboard shortcuts and hotkey management
//! - Text input buffering and editing capabilities
//! - Clipboard integration for copy/paste operations

/// Central coordinator for all input processing operations
///
/// This struct will manage the complete input pipeline including:
/// - Raw keyboard event capture from the terminal
/// - Event filtering and preprocessing
/// - Command parsing and validation
/// - Input mode state management
/// - Text editing operations (insert, delete, navigation)
/// - Hotkey and shortcut handling
///
/// The InputHandler will work closely with the UI event system to provide
/// responsive and intuitive keyboard interaction patterns similar to vim
/// and other terminal-based applications.
///
/// Currently contains only placeholder methods for future implementation.
